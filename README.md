## FAQ

*Q:* Why not write a code formating tool like `go fmt` instead?
*A:* The purpose of a formating tool is formating source code while the
purpose of this tool is warning about style mistakes. Some of the
mistakes abuild-lint currently warns about could be automatically fixed
by a formating tool and might be handled by a formating tool one day.

*Q:* What's the difference between `abuild sanitycheck` and abuild-lint?
*A:* `abuild sanitycheck` is concerned with the semantical correctness
of an APKBUILD while abuild-lint is concerned with the syntactical
correctness.
